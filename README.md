# TXT-edit with font changer
Simple text editor with save and open methods and 4 different fonts. You can access the save and load functions by clicking 
on the drop-down menu labeled "Functions" and fonts you can change from "Fonts" -menu.

Editor includes two png-images, which are used as icons in the program drop-down menu.
You need to put SimpleNotepad.py, NotepadOpen.png and NotepadSace.png files to the same directory,
because without this the program program will not work.
