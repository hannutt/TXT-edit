# TXT-edit
Simple text editor with save and open methods. You can access the save and load functions by clicking 
on the drop-down menu labeled "Functions".
Editor includes two png-images, which are used as icons in the program drop-down menu.
You need to put SimpleNotepad.py, NotepadOpen.png and NotepadSace.png files to the same directory,
because without this the program program will not work.
